# A Little Survey

Here are just a few questions so I can get to know you and so you can get practice submitting an assignment in Canvas.  For each question, insert your answer underneath. Make sure each answer is at the minimum a complete sentence with correctly spelled words and correct puncuation. Half the points in this assignment depend on your picture and name being correct!!  Be sure to put your photo in the Files folder and call it My_photo.jpg after first renaming the current one to Koala.jpg. Suggest you email a selfie to yourself which you download, then use the upload option in the Files pane (lower right pane).  Ask a neighbor or a geek friend if you are stuck. One other thing to do is to edit the gitCredentials.txt file to reflect your name and email address - not Dr K's.
